      <h3>Assignment: </h3><p> Class project for CSE 170: Interaction Design;</br> Studio focus: Collaboration and Crowdsoursing; </br>Project completed in 2.5 Months in a team of 4. </br></p>
      <h3>Task: </h3><p> How can crowdsourcing be utilized to solve major social, academic and commercial issues?</p>
      <h3>My Role: </h3><p> I conducted needfinding excercies, created storyboards, paper prototypes, user testing, A/B testing, and front-end development.</br> </p>
      <h3>Process: </h3>
      <h4>Ideation:</h4>
      <p> During ideation for our project we realized that: Community service benefits local areas by connecting people and raising awareness between members of that community. However, nowadays, many people barely interact with one another, yet are frustrated by the lack of action being done. Problems such as potholes in streets, no safe places for children to play, or abundances of litter and trash are just ignored or complained about.</p>
      <h4>Need Finding:</h4>
      <p> We found that Come Togetherâ€™s target audience revolved around those involved in communities, so we searched for people who not only played an active part in their communities but who also were not very involved, in order to garner a wide spectrum of possible users. What we found was that citizens who just wanted a simple fix done were tired of waiting for city action to create or approve solutions.</p>
      <h4>Our Solution:</h4>
      <p>To solve this problem, Come Together creates an environment that cultivates community involvement and empowerment in local projects. Our platform allows people to create or join projects they are passionate about. We were inspired by the power of crowdsourcing and the idea that each person can have a unique skill to contribute. While our competitors focus on more individualistic and/or monetary-based needs, Come Together focuses on community works that benefit local citizens in their immediate area.</p>

      <h4>Prototyping:</h4>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" style="height: 580px" src="flow1.png"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" style="height: 580px" src="flow2.png"/></div>
      </div>
      <p>When prototyping, we decided to utilize the Google Maps API in order to help users look for relevant projects in their own area. After having our app reviewed by peers using Nielsen's Ten Heuristics, we found that they loved the Maps API usage and decided to focus on it by making it a key feature of the app.</p>
      
       <h4> User Testing:</h4>
      <p>During testing with a product manager and design student, they stated that they had no issue with navigation, however the PM wanted more visual consistency (particularly with our corners), while the student did not enjoy how user input was vague. Based on this feedback, we went straight to fixing these concerns.</p>

      <h4>Presentation:</h4>
       <p>On March 17, 2017 we had our final presentations for the class that included a presentation and poster session. At the end of the presentation, Scott Klemmer awarded our project the "Changing the World" award.</p>

      <h4>Final Product:</h4>
