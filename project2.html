      <h3>Assignment: </h3><p> Class project for COGS 187A: Usability and Information Architechture;</br> Project completed in 3 weeks in a team of 4. </br></p>
      <h3>Task: </h3><p> 1. Analyze the major streaming music application at the time</br>2. Redesign a mobile music app with playlist management  </p>
      <h3>My Role: </h3><p> I conducted user interviews, compared user experience of user scenarios, completed competitive analysis of information architecture, help create wireframes, and completed QA testing of the prototype.</br> </p>
      <h3>Design Process </h3>
      <h4>User Interviews:</h4>
      <p> We interviewed 9 people who regularly listened to music on their mobile phone and actively use a streaming music platform. Many of the questions involved playlist management and if he or she had any frustrations with their music application.</br> 

      </br>These were some of the questions we asked:</br></p>
        <ul type="disc">
        </br>
          <li>Do you listen to music using a streaming service (such as Spotify, Apple music)?</li>
          <li>What do you like about your music streaming app?</li>
          <li>What you dislike or find frustrating about your music streaming app?</li>
          <li>How do you discover new music?</li>
        </ul>

      <p></br>From our 9 interviews, we were able to find a total of 9 distict user scenarios based on each person's interview. The user scenarios helped us predict how users will interact with our application in order to complete a goal.</p>
      <h4>User Senarios:</h4>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-12"><img class="img-responsive" style="height: 1000px; width: 100%;" src="screen.pdf"/></div>
        </div>
      <p> From our 9 user scenarios, we compared the steps taken on Spotify, Amazon Music, Soundcloud, Ganna, and Apple Music. 
      </br></br>These were some of our user senarios:</br></p>
        <ul type="disc">
        </br>
          <li>Re-ordering songs in a playlist</li>
          <li>Deleting a song from a playlist</li>
          <li>Renaming a playlist</li>
          <li>Creating a playlist for a Dance Party</li>
        </ul>
        <p></br>Once we completed the user senarios on two different music apps, we compared the workflows for each senario and labeled which app had a better user experience. In the screenshot above Spotify has a better user experience for this scenario compared to Amazon Music.
        </p>
        
      <h4>Competitive Analysis:</h4>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-sm-12"><img class="img-responsive" style="height: 1000px; width: 100%;" src="screen2.pdf"/></div>
        </div>
      <p>For three of the music applications, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify, we compared how each of the three apps displayed their navigation structures and how they classified their genres and non-genres. The screenshot above shows our hierarchical sitemap for Amazon Music with key page details showing the main pages of the app.
      </p>

      <h4>Wireframes:</h4>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" style="height: 600px; width: 100%;" src="flow3.jpg"/></div>
        <div class="col-sm-6"><img class="img-responsive" style="height: 600px; width: 100%;" src="flow4.jpg"/></div>
      </div>
      <p></br>We created our wireframe for two activies based on our analysis of our user scenarios: Creating a playlist and Managing a playlist. We also decided to design the navigation of our application in a way that is extremely intuitive and simple, in our interviews, we had multiple interviewees struggle to differentiate the two search bars in Spotify they were unsure if they were searching the playlist that was currently in scope or if they were going to search Spotify’s catalog. Additionally, interviewees struggled at finding the search bar in Spotify when in a playlist. So we tried to address that by letting users choose where he or she wants to search.</p>
      
      <h4>Challenges:</h4>
      <p>In our exploration of music streaming apps, we noticed many minor differences between music apps; however, one “feature” that seemed to be prevalent throughout all the music apps is that we could only add a song to each individual playlist at a time. We also observed this during our interviews, many users seemed to have the same song in multiple playlist and when we observed users adding songs into their playlists, users mentioned that a pain point across all music applications is the inability to add songs to multiple existing playlist. So we decided that this would be a good pain point to relieve in our re-design. In the re-design, clicking on the three vertical dots next to each song will be up a pop-up box that has an option to add that song to a playlist. After a user clicks the "add song to playlist” a new pop-up box with a list of existing playlists and the user can select as many playlist(s) as he or she wants to put that song into. We also struggled with the design for the navigation bar as well - specifically how many items to place in the navigation bar and where to place it. Many competing applications have 4 - 5 items in their navigational bars, but many of the options remain unused. In all of our interviews only three items were consistently used: Browse, My Music, and Search. We decided to declutter our navigation bar and bring it down to just the most basic two options: Browse and My Music. The essence of a music app is to find and store music in a classified manner and we tried to stay true to that by simplfying the navigation on the bottom.</p>

      <h4>Conclusions:</h4>
       <p>Conducting user research was essential in helping us address fundamental issues and gather data on how users will use the product. User scenarios allowed us to predict how users will interact with the product and it helped us learn and understand the goals and motivations of the user. Creating a competitive analysis with multiple music applications showed us what good user experience and flow looks like and helped us redesign and improve the experience. Overall, I learned ideations extremely important, but thorough user research is the foundation to creating an enjoyable user experience.</p>

      <h4>Final Product:</h4>
